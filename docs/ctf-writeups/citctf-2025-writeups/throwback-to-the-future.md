## TL;DR

What date was Anthony McConnolly's "throwback" photo taken? After researching his X (Twitter) account, performing a reverse image search, and identifying key details, I concluded that the photo was taken during a game between the **New England Patriots** and the **Buffalo Bills** at **Gillette Stadium** on **October 22, 2023**.

## Solution

### Step 1: Investigating the Challenge

Since the challenge is about Anthony McConnolly, I decided to browse through his X (Twitter) account [Anthony McConnolly (@antmcconn) / X](https://x.com/antmcconn) to find the throwback photo. After a bit of scrolling, I came across this post:

### Step 2: Analyzing the Photo

After finding the tweet with the photo, I looked closely at the caption. It said:

"[**#throwback**](https://x.com/hashtag/throwback?src=hashtag_click) to the 2023 season. The MVP still can’t beat us when we’re at home."

* The use of "2023" clearly indicates that the photo was taken in that year.
* The word "season" suggested that it was a football game, not just an exhibition.

Next, I performed a **reverse image search** to see if the photo was used elsewhere on the internet. Here are the results:

<figure><img src="https://3066381948-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F1v4zpYg12djm83qExa3x%2Fuploads%2FZGJ8xd69nZHBoT9dlAs5%2FPasted%20image%2020250427174213.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4ed8e244-5e04-4b0d-aed3-79d4828a0737" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Although the reverse image search didn’t yield any exact matches, I noticed some related search terms that might be useful: "**Gillette Stadium**" and "**New England Patriots**." I saved these names for later reference.

### Step 3: Identifying Clues in the Photo

Upon closer inspection of the photo, I noticed another clue:

It seemed to feature another team logo, so I decided to look it up. After searching for the name visible on the uniform, I discovered the second team: **Buffalo Bills**.

***

### Step 4: Confirming the Teams

To confirm that these were indeed the correct teams, I did some cross-referencing. I examined the uniforms of both teams. The **Buffalo Bills** usually wear white uniforms, while the **New England Patriots** wear darker ones.



_**Note: I am not sure about who the players are in this photo, as I was mainly trying to match the uniforms to confirm the team identities. If I made any mistakes regarding the players, I apologize.**_

### Step 5: Finding the Game Date

<sup>_Note for the image above: I’m not entirely sure who the players are currently wearing these uniforms. I’m just trying to match the uniforms to see if the designs align with the photo I was given. If I got the players wrong, my apologies!_</sup>

With the teams confirmed as the **New England Patriots** and the **Buffalo Bills**, I searched for more details. I typed "Patriots vs Bills Gillette Stadium 2023" into Google and found the game took place on **October 22, 2023**.

Here is the search result:

### Step 6: Converting the Date to MM/DD/YYYY Format

The date of the game was **October 22, 2023**. In the required format, this becomes:

**10/22/2023**

I submitted this as the flag, and it was accepted.

## Final Flag

```
10/22/2023
```

## Notes

* Always check related searches in reverse image search for location and teams.
* Verifying uniform designs helps confirm team identities and season.
* Image captions can provide immediate year or event clues.
